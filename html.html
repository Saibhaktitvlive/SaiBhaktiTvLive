<p><img alt="Introduction" class="img-responsive history-tab-img" src="https://sai.org.in/sites/all/themes/sai/img/history/introduction-sai-baba.jpg">The extracts in this anthology are taken from Shri Sat Charitra. They comprise parts of Chapters in which the author, Shri Govind Raghunath Dabolkar alias Hemadpant refers to Saibaba his devotees and vision.</p>

<h2>Shri Sai Baba intorduction</h2>

<p>Shri Sai Baba is revered as one of the greatest saints ever seen in India, endowed with unprecedented powers, and is worshipped as a God incarnate. (SAI meaning Sakshaat Ishwar) - GOD THE ABSOLUTE</p>

<p>This mysterious Fakir first made his appearance in Shirdi as a youth and remained there throughout his long life. HE transformed the lives of those who met him and continuously is doing so even after his Samadhi in 1918 for those whose hearts are touched by his love and who pray and call him at any emergency in life for his blessings.</p>

<p>Baba stated that his mission is to “Give Blessings” without discrimination to all, and he proves it in myriad ways by healing the sick, saving lives, protecting the vulnerable, averting accidents, granting offspring, facilitating financial gain, bringing people into harmony within themselves and with each other and, above all, in effecting the spiritual evolution and transformation of those who came to him as the last resort.</p>

<p>Baba is, as one of his contemporary devotees put it, “The embodiment of the Supreme Spirit lighting the sadhaka's (seekers') path by His every word and action”.</p>

<p>To his devotees, Baba is nothing less than a GOD. This has been a matter of experience and not imaginary.</p>

<p>“I look on all with an equal eye”</p>

<p>An outstanding aspect of Sai Baba is that he is beyond distinctions of religion, caste or creed. He embodied all religions and preached the Universal religion of Love.</p>

<p>Devotees of all faiths find their meeting point in Sai and people from all communities and all walks of life are united by the great love and reverence Baba inspires in them. Baba had great regard for his hindu devotees and their Gurus and he responded to their needs and permitted worship according to the hindu and other religious rituals. At the same time his dwelling place was a Masjid (Mosque) and the name of Allah was ever on his lips. HE described himself as in Service to GOD (ALLAH) and as a soul ever remembering ALLAH -(YAD - A - HAKKA)</p>

<p>People today flock Shirdi in ever-increasing numbers to pay homage to the Divine and to experience the truth of Baba’s promise that He would be active in answering devotees' prayers even from his tomb. Like Ten Commandments BABA has given eleven assurances to humanity for welfare.</p>

<p>Baba said that he was a slave in the service of those who loved him that he was ever living to help those who turn to him and that he has to take care of his children day and night. He then taught values of total surrender to the Almighty Master (ALLAH MALIK EK- The only ONE) and experience his grace.</p>

<p>In coming to Baba’s Shirdi His children experience the truth how BABA unfailingly fulfils his commitments to his devotees by coming to their rescue in times of crisis.</p>

<h2>Appearance and first arrival</h2>

<p><img alt="Origins" class="img-responsive history-tab-img" src="https://sai.org.in/sites/all/themes/sai/img/history/origin.jpg">
</p><p> No one knows anything about Shri Sai Baba's parents, place of birth or birth. Baba and others have asked many questions about this but inquiries have been made but no convincing answers or information is still available. </p>

<p> For the devotees, Shri Sai Baba appeared under a neem tree as a young man. Even then, he felt perfect in theology. They did not expect worldly pleasures or possessions even in their dreams. He used to say, "Love and salvation are at my feet." Apart from formal education or discussion of philosophy, only their blessings saved the souls of many. While blessing all the devotees, he said only three words, "Allah will do good" (by the grace of God, all will be well). </p>

<h2> An old man from Shirdi described them as follows. </h2>

<p> This handsome young man was first seen sitting under a neem tree. The people of Shirdi were shocked to see this young man doing hard penance under the neem tree regardless of cold or heat. Day and night no one was with him, at night he was not afraid of anything. People used to wonder and say to each other, "When did this young man come?" His personality was so enticing that it was pleasing to look at him. They never went to anyone's house. Constantly sitting under the neem. Apparently, although he looked young, he seemed to be a great soul by his words and deeds. It was an idol of peace. </p>

It is said that one day the god Khandoba came into the body of a devotee. People asked Khandoba, “God, this is the son of a virtuous father. And when did you get here? ”<p></p>

<p> God Khandoba told them to bring spades, shovels and dig in special places. Then they saw bricks under the spreading stone. After removing the stones and bricks, they saw the road leading to the basement. Gomukhi wooden pots and rosaries were seen in the basement. </p>

Khandoba said, "This young man has been here for twelve years." When people asked the young man, he said, "This is my Guru's place." He urged the people to take good care of their Guru's land. <p></p>

<p> Thus young Sai Baba stayed in Shirdi for three years. He then suddenly disappeared and reappeared near Aurangabad in the Nizam's kingdom. And at the age of about 20 years, Dhoop came to Shirdi with his wife and son-in-law from the house of Patil Chandbhai of village Dhoop. </p>

<h2> Return to Shirdi </h2>

<p> A Muslim gentleman named Chandpatil was living in the village of Dhup in Aurangabad district. Once, while on his way to Aurangabad, he lost his horse. After two months of searching for the horse, no investigation was started. Disappointed, he put the saddle on his shoulder and left Aurangabad. After walking for four and a half kos, they saw a fakir sitting under a mango tree. The fakir was wearing a hat on his head and a shroud on his body. Seeing Chand Patla, Fakira invited him to drink chilli and rest for a while. When the fakir asked him about the saddle, Chandpatil said that it was the saddle of his lost horse. The fakir asked Chandpatal to find a horse in the Jatal river. What a surprise that would have been! The mare was found. Chandpatal thought that this fakir was not an ordinary person but a great saint or Mahatma. Chandpatil came to Fakir with a horse. Chilim was ready to pull. Only two things are needed, water for lighting the chimney and water for printing. When the fakir hit his tweezers on the ground, burning embers came out. The fiery fakir threw it on the fire. He then hit Satka on the ground. From there came the fountain of water. Seeing all this, Chandpatal was very surprised. Fakira soaked the print and rolled up the pipe. You pulled the chilim yourself and then gave it to Chandpatla. He requested the fakir to come to his house. The next day he went to Chandpatal's house and stayed for some time. Patil was the village officer of Dhup village. Her son-in-law was married at Shirdi. Patil was preparing to go to Shirdi for marriage. He also requested this fakir to come for marriage. Accordingly, the fakir came to Shirdi with the bride and groom. The marriage passed safely. Varat Dhup went back to the village. The fakir remained in Shirdi forever. </p>

<h2> The Baba got the name "Sai " </h2>

<p> This incense of the village of Dhoop stopped under the Vada tree in the courtyard of the Khandoba temple of Shirdi, which is on the road. Leaving the vehicles in the open field, one by one got out of the vehicle. As the fakir was descending, Khandoba's priest Mhalpasapati saw him and greeted him intimately as "Ya Sai" (Aao Sai). This name later became popular and came to be known as 'Sai Baba'. </p>

On his return to Shirdi, he remained in Shirdi for sixty years, till his death. His great Nirvana took place on Tuesday, October 15, 1918. <p></p>

<p> Initially, Baba used to live on the Shiva of Shirdi. Later, for four to five years, they lived under the neem tree which is now called Gurusthan. Later he went to live in such a neglected mosque. That mosque is called "Dwarkamai" today. </p>

<p> People noticed their importance. His fame spread far and wide and in the aftermath of his incarnation work, he attracted thousands of people to Shirdi. In the last decade of his life, his pooja started with all the puja literature. And Dwarakamai received the form of a royal court. Yet Baba has not changed his simple lifestyle. </p>

<h2>Wonderful Incarnation</h2>

<p><img alt="Wonderful Incarnation" class="img-responsive history-tab-img" src="https://sai.org.in/sites/all/themes/sai/img/history/wonderful-incarnation.jpg"><strong>Sai Baba as a Yogi- Satchidanand SATGURU</strong></p>

<p>Sai Baba knew all yogic practices. He was well versed in the six processes including Dhauti, Khandayoga and Samadhi, etc. He demonstrated His mastery over yogic exercises many a time.</p>

<p>Yet, if you think that he was a Hindu, He looked like a Yavan. If you think Him to be a Yavan, he looked like a pious Hindu. No one definitely knew whether he was a Hindu or a Mohammedan. Inferences could be drawn from His dress or body features but all such superficial inferences were meaningless. They did not serve any purpose.</p>

<p>He celebrated the Hindu festival of Rama-Navami with all due formalities and at the same time permitted the ‘Sandal’ procession of the Mohammedans. He encouraged wrestling bouts in this festival and gave good prizes to winners. When the Gokul Ashtami came, he got the ‘Gopal-Kala’ ceremony duly performed and on Id festivals, he allowed Mohammedans to say their prayers (Namaj) in his masjid.</p>

<p>Once in the Moharum festival, some Mohammedans proposed to construct a Tajiya or Tabut in the Masjid, keep it there for some days and afterwards take it in the procession through the village. Sai Baba allowed the keeping of the Tabut for four days and on the fifth day removed it out of the Masjid without the least compunction. He allowed all the devotees to celebrate festivals at Shirdi according to their preferences and the various religious in vogue adopted by them. In Baba's Masjid except a garlanded wall there is no image or photograph of any deity.</p>

<p>If we say that he was a Mohammedan, his ears were pierced (i.e. had holes according to Hindu fashion). If you think that he was a Hindu, he advocated the practice of circumcision (though according to Mr Nanasaheb Chandorkar, who observed him closely, he was not himself circumcised. Wide article in Sai Leela on "Baba Hindu Ki Yavan" by B.V. Deo, page 562). If you call him Hindu, he always lived in the Masjid; if Mohammedan, he had always the Dhuni - sacred fire there, and the following things which are contrary to Mohammedan religion, i.e., grinding on the hand mill, blowing of the conch and bells, oblation in the fire, Bhajan, giving of food, and worship of Baba’s Feet by means of ARDHYA (water) were always allowed there. If you think that he was a Mohammedan, the best of Brahmins and Agnihotris, leaving aside their orthodox ways, fell prostrate at his feet. Those who went to make enquiries about his nationality were dumb-founded and were captured by his Darshana. He gave visions of all the respective Gurus and deities according to devotees choice whether expressed or hidden. Baba, when asked about his creed, to that he belonged to Saint Kabir's creed.</p>

<p>So none could definitely decide whether Sai Baba was a Hindu or a Mohammedan. This is no wonder; for he who completely surrenders himself to the Lord, by getting rid of his egoism and body - consciousness thus becomes one with him, and has nothing to do with any questions of caste or nationality. Such a one as Sai Baba was, saw no difference between caste and among beings and beings. He took meat and fish with Fakirs, but did not grumble when dogs touched the dishes with their mouths. Thus Sai Maharaj was beyond all personal references, time and space dimensions.</p>

<p>Such a unique and wonderful GOD incarnation was Sai Baba.</p>

<p>[* Note--(1) Mhalsapati, an intimate Shirdi devotee of Baba, who always slept with Him in the Masjid and Chavadi, said that Sai Baba told him that he was a Brahmin of Pathari and was handed over to a Fakir in his infancy, and when He told this, some men from Pathari had come, and Baba was enquiring about some men from that place. [Vide Sai Leela 1924, Page 179. (2) Mrs. Kashibai Kanitkar, the famous learned woman of Poona says in the experience No.8, published on Page 79, Sai Leela Vol. 11,1934, - "On hearing of Baba’s miracles, we were discussing according to our theosophical convention and fashion whether Sai Baba belonged to black or white lodge. When once I went to Shirdi, I was thinking seriously about this in my mind. As soon as I approached the steps of the Masjid, Baba came to the front and pointing to His chest and staring at me spoke rather vehemently -"This is a Brahmin, pure Brahmin. He has nothing to do with black things. No Musalman can dare to step in here. He dare not." Again pointing to his chest - "This Brahmin can bring lacks of men on the white path and take them to their destination. This is a Brahmin’s Masjid and I won’t allow any black Mohammedan to cast his shadow here."]</p>

<p>Sai Baba is widely regarded as an incarnation of God, but he always said that he was an obedient servant of God. Though an incarnation he showed the people the way how to behave satisfactorily and carry out the duties of their respective stations (Varnas) in this life. He never emulated others in any way, nor asked others to have something done for him. For him, Who saw the Lord in all movable and immovable things of this world, humility was the most proper thing. None he disregarded or disrespected; for he saw Narayan (Lord) in all beings, he never said, "I am God," but that he was a humble servant and he always remembered him and always uttered - "Allah Malik" (God is the sole proprietor or Owner). By his thoughts and worldly behavior He established ideal values and virtues of faith, patience and humanity. One should concentrate on and do faithfully one's duties assigned to him/her by GOD and wait patiently for the results (fruits) of his action (Karma) because the effect of any cause is always determined by GOD.</p>
